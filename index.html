            Right now, I have a 3-year old son, named <b>George</b>. And I work in family-owned company. Although I am still traveling around for business, I do not enjoy it as how I did before. Also, I am too scared to do <sup>scuba diving</sup> or <sup>other adventure activities</sup>.

            It is not easy to be a Mom. However, I will keep learning and trying to do my best.
